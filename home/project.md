### Collaboration

I'm @Pj Hooker and I'm an author. I invite anyone to become an author like me. The authors will become students of the academy. To become a student it is possible to follow one of the paths described in the [dedicated section](https://github.com/piergiorgio-roveda/gistips-academy/blob/main/faq/become-a-student.md).
