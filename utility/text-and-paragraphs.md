### Best tools found

#### [Fancy Text Generator](https://lingojam.com/FancyTextGenerator)

You get a great selection of fonts here from aesthetic fonts to handwriting-style fonts, and so on. All you have to do is type your text into the left-hand side box, and then the tool will generate a whole selection of fonts on the right-hand side. I've found it very quick and easy to use.

#### [Vaporwave Text Generator](https://lingojam.com/VaporwaveTextGenerator)

This tool generates fonts that are similar of the "vaporwave" trend, including aesthetic and wider fonts. If you want to get in on the internet trend, then this is the tool to use.
