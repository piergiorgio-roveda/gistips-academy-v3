  When it comes to GIS it is difficult to have a single definition. This is
  because GIS are simply software, but to use them it is necessary to study a
  logic.

# Concept

[> GTA-v3](../README.md)
* * *


&#x20;The Academy is built to host these logics and create methods, to be used:

* for creating map
* for analyzing geographic data
* for publishing some maps on your website

In this Academy the watchword is to learn and the best way is to share our experiences, with contents, examples and links.

The first community that inspired this Academy was created in 2012 ([history](history.md)) and this takes positive experiences.

## Community-driven academy

Community driven development ([CDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community-driven\_development)) is a development initiative that provides control of the development process, resources and decision making authority directly to groups in the community.

The underlying assumption is this community is the best judges of how its users can be improved and they can organize themselves to provide for community needs.

This type of community is an entity with no central leadership. Decisions get made from the bottom-up, governed by a community organized around a specific set of rules.

It is internet-native organizations collectively owned and managed by their members. For example, in the future the Academy could have built-in treasuries that are only accessible with the approval of their members and decisions will be made via proposals the group votes on during a specified period.

## Topics

The contents will always refer to maps, GIS and geolocation. The domains in which GIS is applied largely fall into those concerned with [the human world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human\_geography) (e.g., [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic\_geography), [politics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political\_geography), [transportation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation\_geography), [education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education), [landscape architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landscape\_architecture), [archaeology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeology), [urban planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban\_planning), [real estate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real\_estate), [public health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public\_health), [crime mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime\_mapping), [national defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense\_\(military\))), and those concerned with [the natural world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical\_geography) (e.g., [geology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological\_mapping), [biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogeography), [oceanography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanography), [climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatology)). That said, one of the powerful capabilities of GIS and the spatial perspective of geography is their integrative ability to compare disparate topics, and many applications are concerned with multiple domains.

Examples of integrated human-natural application domains include [Natural hazard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural\_hazard) mitigation, [wildlife management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife\_management), [sustainable development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable\_development), [natural resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural\_resources), and [climate change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate\_change) response. (soruce Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia: [Geographic information system > Applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic\_information\_system#Applications)).

## Collect, organize methods and operational tools

The logic around the GIS can be represented as a Cybernetic Loop. Inside the Academy this complex scheme can be explored by analyzing the individual phases. Discussions, examples and tutorials always refer to this outline and are organized by identifying exactly which part is highlighted.

## Communication activities

{% hint style="info" %}
Dissemination all over the world through communication activities.
{% endhint %}

The best way to spread your knowledge, interests and passions is to make them available in the right way. The method used in the Academy derives from [SEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search\_engine\_optimization) techniques, where the way to create content is derived from the underlying functioning of the internet. Marketing activities are a consequence. Direct or misleading advertising is prohibited from Academy!

The Academy invites you to create unique content, full of insights and discussions. The [Awareness committee](structure.md#committees) is responsible for capturing this method of communication.

## Community without cost

The Academy uses internet resources for free, but internet consumes extraordinary amounts of energy. This documentation is write on GitBook with free account and all other resources have the same cost. In the Academy we can explore the free tools available and learn how to use them. Some tools are hard to find and must be made available by community members or donors. For example PHP, Geoserver, Postgres are hard to find.
