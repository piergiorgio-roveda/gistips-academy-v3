# Privacy

## No one can ask for personal information on behalf of the Academy, both inside and outside, but all can place name or nickname everywhere

## Users can be anonymous for ever

## Single support reference

{% hint style="info" %}
Support committee is the only reference for non-public needed
{% endhint %}

For many reasons, the only support reference is this email [lima.cityplanner@gmail.com](mailto:lima.cityplanner@gmail.com) which is my personal email. I am the only person who can read it and there will never be third parties who can access this email. Regarding the published content, each author can decide whether to publish his own reference or remain anonymous.
